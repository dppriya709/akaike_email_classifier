Step 1: Define the Problem
Objective: You are building a system that classifies support team emails and detects and masks Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as phone numbers, email addresses, Aadhar numbers, etc.

PIMTs:

Input: JSON containing the subject and body of the email.

Output: JSON containing:

Masked email content with PII replaced by placeholders.

Detected PII details (type, position, original text).

The predicted category (e.g., Complaint, Query).

Step 2: Collect and Preprocess Data
Objective: You need a custom labeled dataset with email samples, annotated with PII and their corresponding categories (e.g., complaint, query).

PIMTs:

Data Collection: You can either use real email data (after ensuring privacy and compliance with regulations) or generate synthetic email data.

Data Annotation: Label the data manually or use an automated tool to mark PII elements and categorize the emails.

Text Preprocessing:

Lowercase the text to make it case-insensitive.

Remove stopwords (common words like "the", "is", etc.) to focus on meaningful content.

Remove special characters and numbers, leaving only the essential parts of the text for classification.

Tools for Preprocessing: Python libraries like nltk, spaCy, or regex.

Step 3: Build the PII Masking System
Objective: Detect PII such as phone numbers, email addresses, Aadhar numbers, dates, and expiry numbers in the email content and replace them with placeholders.

PIMTs:

Use Regular Expressions (Regex):

Phone numbers: Regex patterns like \b\d{3}[-]?\d{3}[-]?\d{4}\b.

Emails: Regex patterns like \b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,7}\b.

Aadhar Numbers: Custom regex pattern like \b\d{4}-\d{4}-\d{4}\b.

Dates/Expiry: Use regex patterns that capture common date formats.

Named Entity Recognition (NER):

You can also use spaCy to detect named entities like person names, organizations, and locations, which may sometimes be PII.

Masking PII:

Once PII is detected, replace the corresponding text with placeholders like [phone], [email], [aadhar_num].

Record details of each PII element (e.g., position in text, original text, type of PII) for future reference.

Step 4: Build the Text Classification Model
Objective: Train a model to classify emails into predefined categories like "Complaint", "Query", "Return", etc.

PIMTs:

Text Representation:

Use TfidfVectorizer from sklearn to convert the email text into a matrix of token counts. This helps the model understand the text and learn patterns from it.

Model Choice:

You can use machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or even Deep Learning (e.g., LSTM or BERT) for better performance on text classification.

Logistic Regression is a good starting point as itâ€™s simple and works well with features from TfidfVectorizer.

Model Training:

Split your data into training and validation sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).

Train the classifier on the training data and evaluate its performance on the validation set (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).

Step 5: Integrate PII Masking with Classification
Objective: Combine the PII detection system and the classification system so that the final output is both masked and categorized.

PIMTs:

Pipeline Structure:

Input: The system receives a JSON with subject and body of the email.

PII Masking: Use regex and NER to identify and mask PII in both the subject and body.

Text Classification: Use the trained model to predict the category of the email (Complaint, Query, etc.).

Output: Return a JSON with:

Masked subject and body.

A list of detected PII, including type, position, and original text.

Predicted category.

Step 6: Build the API
Objective: Expose the email classification and PII masking functionality through an API that can be called to classify and mask incoming emails.

PIMTs:

API Framework: Use Flask or FastAPI to build a simple API.

Flask is easy to set up and works well for small projects.

FastAPI is faster and designed for modern, high-performance APIs.

API Endpoints:

POST /classify_email: Accepts a JSON with subject and body and returns the processed output (masked text and classification).

Handle exceptions properly (e.g., if input JSON is invalid).

Deploying the API:

You can deploy the API locally first for testing.

Deploy it on a cloud platform like Heroku, AWS, or Azure for production use.

Step 7: Testing and Evaluation
Objective: Ensure the system works correctly and efficiently for real-world use cases.

PIMTs:

Unit Tests: Write tests for each component:

Test PII masking with a variety of emails.

Test classification accuracy on unseen data.

Performance Testing: Ensure the system can handle a large number of requests if needed.

Model Evaluation: If you're using machine learning, evaluate the model's performance (e.g., confusion matrix, F1 score) and improve it by experimenting with hyperparameters or different models.

Real-World Testing: Test the system with real customer emails to ensure accuracy and reliability.
