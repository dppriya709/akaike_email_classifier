Email Classifier & PII Masking System - README

üîç Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the internship assignment for Akaike Technologies. It builds an API that processes support team emails to:

Detect and mask Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

Classify emails into predefined categories (e.g., complaint, query, return)

‚úÖ Step-by-Step Breakdown with PIMTs

Step 1: Define the Problem

Problem: Manual email handling is inefficient and unsafe.

Input: JSON with subject and body.

Output: JSON with:

Masked content

PII details (type, position, original)

Email category (e.g., Complaint)

Step 2: Collect and Preprocess Data

Problem: No labeled dataset

Input: Email dataset

Methods:

Collect real or synthetic emails

Annotate manually or semi-automatically

Tools: nltk, spaCy, regex

Preprocessing Includes:

Lowercasing

Stopword removal

Removing special characters and extra numbers

Step 3: Build the PII Masking System

Methods:

Regex patterns for phone, email, Aadhar, dates

spaCy for NER (e.g., names, locations)

Tools: re, spaCy

Masking: Replace with placeholders like [email], [phone_number]

Step 4: Build the Classification Model

Vectorization: TfidfVectorizer

Model: LogisticRegression (or similar)

Pipeline:

Train/test split (80/20)

Model training and evaluation

Step 5: Integrate Everything

Pipeline:

Input JSON ‚Üí

PII Masking ‚Üí

Text Cleaning ‚Üí

Vectorization ‚Üí

Classification ‚Üí

JSON Output

Step 6: Build the API

Framework: FastAPI or Flask

Endpoint: POST /classify

Deployment:

Local for testing

Cloud (e.g., Hugging Face Spaces)

Step 7: Testing and Evaluation

Methods:

Unit tests for masking and classification

Confusion matrix, F1 score for model

Real-world email testing

üöÄ API Sample Usage

Endpoint: POST /classify

## API Endpoints

- **POST /classify**
  - Input: Email body as a string.
